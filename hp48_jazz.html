This document will introduce you to Jazz, *the* programming environment for the HP48.
It provides an easy way to compile small things like the examples on my page,
although the library and the entries require ~100Kb.<BR>
</CENTER>

<H1>Files:</H1>
You will need two rather large libraries before you can start. These are the Jazz library
and the entries (explanation later). Follow the link on the main page to Mika Heiskanen's
homepage if you haven't already downloaded Jazz. You can also get Goodies Disk #11 from
<A HREF="http://www.jps.net/joehorn/HP48.htm" TARGET="_top">Joe Horn</A> where you will find an entire directory related to Jazz. Included is also the Hack
library. <BR>
Now install both Jazz and the entries library in port 0/1, turn your HP48 off then back on
and you're on the way.<BR>

<H1>A simple example</H1>
Let's see what we can do. Lets start by compiling a simple sys-rpl program to multiply two
numbers, let them be real numbers. <BR>
Type <PRE> "" ED </PRE> this will start the intended sys-rpl/ml editor with an empty string
(this editor only works on strings). You should see a cursor blinking away. Turn on alpha
keys in the usual way and press leftshift [-], the sequence normally used to start a
program. You will see a empty sys-rpl program, and the cursor will automatically jump
down and indent:<PRE>::
&nbsp;<- this is where the cursor will be
;</PRE>
Now type the necessary commands to multiply two reals, preferrably with argument checking
(of course you can leave out the comments):
<PRE>
::
  CK2NOLASTWD			( check for two arguments )
  CKREAL SWAP CKREAL		( check for reals in both stack levels )
  %*				( multiply them )
;   
</PRE>
Note that you can either press [SPC] to insert a space between the arguments, or you can
press [ENTER] to automatically insert a carriage-return and indent (alpha keys must be
activated). <BR>
Now turn off alpha keys and push the string to the stack by pressing the enter-key (the
on-key is only for interrupting things). Assemble the program with <PRE>ASS</PRE> and you
should see something like<PRE> External External ... </PRE> on the stack. (Wow!) <BR>
Try it out on two numbers. Observe that as there is no argument checking with commands like 
%* and SWAP we had to make sure for ourselves that the stack really contained two reals,
otherwise bad things could happen... <P>
Let us now try another useful command, the DISassemble command (DIS). Put your newly created
program on the stack and DIS it. Check that out! Your program was converted into the
source you just wrote. Very good for checking out other peoples work. You could also check
out what HP has done in a command. We'll try it out. Put { DROP } on the stack and DIS it.
Run ED. You will only see<PRE>
{
  xDROP
}</PRE> which is just what the user-rpl command DROP looks like in sys-rpl (exlcuding 
the list of course). Place the marker on xDROP and press rightshift [+/-] to reveal the secret
of DROP. Now what happened here? Well, the command was disassembled, and a new editor
was spawned! You see that CK1 command? That's the one that checks for
arguments. Then there
is a regular DROP without any checks. You could also disassemble this DROP
to see the
machine code beneath it. Press enter a few times to return and exit.

<H1>The entries</H1>
The entries you installed (hopefully) allow us to use nice words like CK2 and CKREAL instead
of typing the address to the entry. Without the entries you would only see things like
PTR 1D39, PTR 15777, etc. If you still encounter these things in your ROM disassembly you
should now that these are just unsupported entries (there are quite a lot of them). Of some
reason, the French programmers like to use the addresses to the entries instead of the
substituted names given by HP. The only advantage of this is more space in your HP48.<P>
<H2>The entries catalog (EC)</H2>
The entries catalog is used to view the entries. You can find entries ([F]) and push the address
of them onto the stack ([ENTER]). Example: type a strange string consisting of a lot of
strange characters, characters that are illegal in a variable name: - + * etc. Launch the
catalog, press F and type $. The browser searches for the first occurrance of this character.
Press [NXT] and navigate your way down to $>ID. You may have to press several times and use
the arrow keys. Once this entry is the top one, press rightshift [ENTER], then exit with [ON].
Assemble the entry and with your string on level two and the entry on level one, press [EVAL].
Be very sure that this is what the stack looks like:
<PRE>2: "....."
1: External </PRE> Now you can store something into this variable!<P>
This may be enough for one day. Read about the commands of the editor in the jazz docs. Once
you get this to work, we may continue with the debuggers. Also try SSTK, the sys-rpl stack!
<P>
<H1>SDB - a sys-rpl debugger</H1>
A great way to find mistakes in your programs is to debug them. There is an inbuilt debugger intendend
for user-rpl and I'm sure you have already used it. It will not work with system level programs
though. This is where SDB comes in. We'll start with an example:
Put your program from above on the stack and execute SDB. Just like you would when debugging
user-rpl. This will start a new SOL (system outer loop), in fact, it will start SSTK. Anyway,
the commands now available are: <BR>
<PRE>
NAME	Unshifted			Rightshifted
->SST:	single steps next command	executes rest of secondary (:: ;)
->IN:	enter next command
SNXT:	show next command
SST->:	toggle continuous mode
	press again to toggle fast/slow
IN->:	like SST-> but for ->IN
DB:	starts DB on next command/code
KILL:	kill program
SKIP:	skip next command
SEXEC:
SBRK:
LOOPS:	Browse loop environments
LAMS:	Browse lambda variables
</PRE>
See the Jazz document for details about the commands. <BR>
Be very careful though when you are debugging since if you mess up the stack, you could
get a crash. If you loose the SDB menu, just execute SDB again. <BR>
